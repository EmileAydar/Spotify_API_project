        "After collecting these playlists for 20 categories (we wanted to limit the data volume for sharper and concise analysis), we have extracted 50 music tracks from each playlist, with their corresponding IDs and associated music metrics, and then stored the whole in a JSON file in order to take account of the nested nature of the metrics data within the playlist within a category. This is the reason using a JSON file is seen as more approriate and a more practical choice for that matter."
